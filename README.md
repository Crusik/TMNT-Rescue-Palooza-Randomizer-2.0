This project is a stage and character randomizer for a "Fan made" TMNT old school Beat 'em Up style game from NES/SNES/GENESIS. You begin with the four turtles, but as you complete each stage it unlocks certain characters that are tied to that stage. This is a project that I originally made with Vanilla JS, but now I am working on converting it to React.JS while adding at least 1-2 new features.

Features:
- Starts with the 4 Turtles, each will start with a count:1 while all other characters will start with count:0. This will allow us to only get each turtle 2 times, but all other characters 3 times.
- As stated above, each character has a count property. When that character is selected it adds to the count for that character. Once the count gets to 3+, that character is no longer available to be selected.
- Each time a Stage is selected, the characters for that Stage are activated and will become available to be selected. If a Stage is removed, the characters for that Stage will be deactivated.
- For each Stage, there will be 2 characters selected for Player 1 and Player 2. Once a character is selected for Player 1, it will automatically select a character for Player 2. After the character for Player 1 is selected, that character will be unavailable for Player 2.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
